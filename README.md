The Home page has a photo of and a small description of who Conan Gray is, the music page has all of Conan Gray's discography, and the vdeos page has my top 3 favorite music videos that Conan Gray produced.

Bootstrap changed my programmimg experience because it has multiple components that can make a website more style than if it didn't have bootstrap.

I wasn't able to keep up with my MVP plan because I changed what I was going to do for my project very last minute.

I am most proud of my carosel for the music videos part because I was able to add a button in it. 

If I had more time, I wouldh've added more styling to my cards.
